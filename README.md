# SOME FAQs

### **1. What makes a password strong?**

A robust password possesses high entropy, rendering it computationally intractable for unauthorized parties to guess. Its strength is a function of several attributes:
* **Substantial Length:** The password's character count should be significant enough to expand the keyspace exponentially, making exhaustive searches infeasible.
* **Character Set Diversity:** It must incorporate a heterogeneous mix of character types, including uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters, numerals, and special symbols, to maximize its complexity.
* **Algorithmic Unpredictability:** It must be devoid of predictable patterns, dictionary words, or personally identifiable information (PII). A strong password approximates a randomly generated string, showing no correlation to the user's identity or common linguistic structures.

### **2. What are common password attacks?**

Threat actors employ several cryptanalytic methodologies to compromise authentication systems. The most prevalent include:
* **Brute Force Attack:** This is an exhaustive key search algorithm where an attacker systematically iterates through all possible character combinations until the correct credential is authenticated. The efficacy of this attack is inversely proportional to the password's length and complexity.
* **Dictionary Attack:** A more heuristic-based approach, this attack utilizes a pre-compiled lexicon of high-probability candidates, such as common words, phrases from breached databases, and simple character substitutions.  It is designed to be more efficient than a pure brute-force attack against non-random passwords.

### **3. Why is password length important?**

Password length is the principal determinant of its cryptographic strength because it directly dictates the size of the total possible keyspace. Each additional character increases the number of potential permutations exponentially, not linearly. This expansion elevates the "attack complexity," meaning the computational time and resources required for a successful brute-force assault grow to a degree that is practically infeasible, effectively moving the password from theoretically secure to functionally unbreakable within a realistic timeframe.

### **4. What is a dictionary attack?**

A dictionary attack is a cryptanalytic technique that attempts to subvert an authentication mechanism by systematically entering every word from a curated list of likely passwords. This "dictionary" is not limited to standard linguistic lexicons but is often an aggregated corpus containing millions of previously leaked passwords, common phrases, and predictable permutations (e.g., "P@ssw0rd"). It operates on the premise that users frequently employ memorable but insecure credentials, making it a highly efficient alternative to an exhaustive brute-force search.

### **5. What is multi-factor authentication?**

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a defense-in-depth security paradigm that requires a user to present a minimum of two distinct, orthogonal pieces of evidence (or "factors") to verify their identity.  This layered approach to authentication ensures that the compromise of a single factor—typically the password—is insufficient to breach the account. These factors are categorized as:
* **Knowledge Factor:** Something the user knows (e.g., a password, a PIN).
* **Possession Factor:** Something the user has (e.g., a mobile device receiving a one-time code, a hardware security key).
* **Inherence/Biometric Factor:** Something the user is (e.g., a fingerprint, a facial scan).

### **6. How do password managers help?**

Password managers are cryptographic utilities designed to mitigate the risks associated with poor password hygiene. Their utility is threefold:
* They algorithmically generate high-entropy, randomized credentials for each distinct service, eliminating the systemic vulnerability of password reuse.
* They store these credentials within a secure, encrypted digital vault, which itself is protected by a single, strong master password.
* They facilitate the seamless and secure auto-filling of credentials, which enhances user convenience and can thwart certain types of malware like keyloggers.

### **7. What are passphrases?**

Passphrases represent an alternative authentication secret, constructed from a concatenated series of words, often interspersed with separators. Their primary advantage lies in their ability to achieve high levels of cryptographic strength through substantial length, which drastically expands the keyspace, while simultaneously offering superior memorability for the user compared to a conventional, random string of characters of equivalent entropy.

---
### **8. What are common mistakes in password creation?**

Common procedural vulnerabilities in password creation often stem from prioritizing convenience over robust security principles. These cryptographic misconfigurations include:
* **Credential Reuse:** Employing a single password across disparate, unrelated systems, creating a single point of failure.
* **Low Entropy:** Constructing passwords from dictionary words, common phrases, or predictable sequential patterns (e.g., "12345"). 
* **Incorporation of PII:** Using personally identifiable information such as dates of birth, names, or addresses, which are often publicly accessible and used in targeted attacks.
* **Insufficient Complexity:** Failing to utilize the full available character set, thereby shrinking the potential keyspace for an attacker to search.
